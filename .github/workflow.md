# Admin panel — current workflow

- Service PR: **#251**. Developer explicitly authorized publication of review reports and service-state updates for the whole SA-04.
- SA-03 is closed; **SA04-A1 merged in main**, PR #327 closed/merged at `593a03964b8407b249f7c9f5eb117ddb8b07736d`.
- **Current stage: SA04-A3 assigned to Lira in cumulative Draft #328; A2 checkpoint PASS remains accepted.**
- Base/current `main`: `593a03964b8407b249f7c9f5eb117ddb8b07736d`.
- Current cumulative Draft implementation **PR #328**, stable exact head `f9da2033455487f25510c2ccbbb748ed5f4bf7f4`, still open/Draft, not merged.
- A2 delivered only `db/account-state.ts` (server-only Drizzle/native active SQL predicate, typed readonly active/deactivated/missing lookup on caller-owned PG connection, readonly assert and distinct unavailable/unexpected classifications) and `tests/database/account-state.test.ts` (six native PG17 read/predicate/error/transaction tests).
- Personal author inspection of both complete files and final exact diff performed, covering correct nullable state semantics, fail-closed error handling, parameterized SQL, no row lock or write, no auth/writer integration and no accidental extra scope. This is not coordinator/independent review.
- **Exact-head [CI #43109939829](https://github.com/iliya1947/vico-forum/actions/runs/43109939829) SUCCESS:** 2237/2237 application tests, 696/696 native PostgreSQL17 tests (6 new A2), 69-table schema manifest parity, lint/typecheck/build/migration metadata/Worker smoke.
- **Active recipient: Lira — SA04-A3 only.** Extend #328 with the transaction/row-lock mutation guard primitive, publish stable exact head/evidence and author inspection, then STOP. A4 is not assigned.
- No runtime auth/session gate, domain writer integration, neutral/public identity projection, deactivate operation/control, SA05+, Stage6/production, #315 remediation, owner visual/deployed acceptance or package merge is asserted.

## Mandatory author verification

Before STOP/handoff, the implementer must personally inspect the completed work across the assigned bounded scope: the actual diff/code, logic, task fit and resulting behavior. Tests, CI, browser checks and other automated evidence support that verification but **do not replace the author's own inspection**. This author verification is not a coordinator or independent whole-PR review and does not replace those later gates.

## Mira mandatory pre-action gate

Before any project-changing action or agent handoff, Mira must check in this order:

1. **Role:** is this action Mira's coordination/review responsibility, or another agent's implementation responsibility?
2. **Authority:** is Mira actually authorized by the current workflow/developer instruction to perform this repository action?
3. **Granularity:** if handing work to Lira, is there exactly one independently completable bounded result?
4. **Preservation:** does the proposed recovery preserve already-useful work instead of discarding/reimplementing it without necessity?
5. Only after all four checks pass may Mira act. If any check fails, do not perform the action; correct the route first.

## Lev review granularity

- Lira implementation granularity and Lev review granularity are different constraints.
- Keep Lira handoffs small and bounded.
- Prefer Lev independent review on a meaningful cumulative stable slice/package, not on every tiny author checkpoint, when the workflow allows waiting without losing a required gate.
- Do not waste an independent review already in progress: if Lev PASSes the current stable bounded PR and it is otherwise ready, close that PR rather than extending it and later making Lev repeat substantially the same review.

## 2026-11-11 — SA04-A1 implementation gate closed

- Lev independent technical review PASS published on exact head `3d6c7c06ac1442a5a4b3ff7f8fbe77454ca8479c`: 0 confirmed current-scope A1 defects.
- Mira coordinator PASS and Lev independent PASS cover the same stable head; `SA04-A1-MIRA-01` is CLOSED.
- PR #327 was converted from Draft to **Ready for review** without changing the implementation head, and its body was corrected to the final factual state.
- Because Lev has already spent a full independent review on this bounded slice, #327 must not be extended with later SA-04 work. Merge this reviewed A1 foundation first; later SA-04 implementation proceeds in a new bounded PR so Lev is not forced to re-review the same A1 work.
- No SA04-A2+, SA-05+, Stage6/production or #315 remediation is started by this closeout.
- **Next action: Owner merge of #327.**

## 2026-11-12 — SA04-A1 post-merge synchronization

- Verified PR #327 merged from the exact reviewed implementation head `3d6c7c06ac1442a5a4b3ff7f8fbe77454ca8479c`.
- Merge commit and current `main`: `593a03964b8407b249f7c9f5eb117ddb8b07736d`.
- SA04-A1 account-state schema foundation is now delivered in main.
- #327 is closed and must not be extended/reused for later SA-04 work.
- No docs closeout is started here because SA-04 as a package is not complete; factual package documentation remains an end-of-task concern.
- No active agent assignment. The next continuation begins the next bounded SA-04 implementation result in a new implementation PR, with Lira kept granular and Lev reserved for a larger meaningful review scope.

## 2026-11-12 — SA04-A2 assigned

- Granularity gate applied to the remainder of Lev's compound checkpoint A.
- Operational split for the remaining A foundation:
  - **A2:** shared server-only account-state read/predicate foundation;
  - **A3:** transaction/row-lock mutation guard primitives;
  - **A4:** neutral public-identity contract/helpers.
- Only **A2** is assigned now. A3/A4 are planning labels, not active assignments, and may be split further before handoff if needed.
- A2 starts a **new cumulative Draft implementation PR** from current main `593a03964b8407b249f7c9f5eb117ddb8b07736d`. Later A checkpoints may be added to that PR only after separate assignments; this avoids spending Lev review on every tiny author checkpoint.
- After A2 author STOP, Mira performs the checkpoint/scope review and decides the next bounded handoff. **No Lev independent review is scheduled at A2 alone.**

## 2026-11-12 — SA04-A2 checkpoint review PASS

- Reviewed cumulative Draft #328 exact head `f9da2033455487f25510c2ccbbb748ed5f4bf7f4`, base/current main `593a03964b8407b249f7c9f5eb117ddb8b07736d`.
- Scope is exactly two files: shared account-state read/predicate foundation + focused PG17 tests.
- PASS — 0 confirmed current-scope A2 defects.
- CI #43109939829 independently confirmed SUCCESS on the same head.
- A2 stays inside cumulative Draft #328. Do not merge and do not spend Lev review on A2 alone.
- Lira STOP. A3/A4 remain unassigned until the next explicit continuation.

## 2026-11-12 — SA04-A3 assigned

- A2 remains checkpoint-PASS on `f9da2033455487f25510c2ccbbb748ed5f4bf7f4`; current main/base remains `593a03964b8407b249f7c9f5eb117ddb8b07736d`.
- Only **A3** is active: one transaction-local mutation admission primitive in the shared account-state foundation, with user-row locking held by the caller-owned transaction through commit/rollback.
- Required concurrency evidence is bounded to the primitive itself; no runtime/domain integration is part of A3.
- Continue cumulative Draft #328. Lira author-inspects A2+A3, publishes stable head/evidence and STOP.
- A4 and all later SA04 checkpoints remain unassigned. Lev remains unassigned.
